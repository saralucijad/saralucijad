## ✨&nbsp; About Me

Marketing graduate currently working as an Executive Assistant at Daytona.io. Through my work, I developed skills in leading, presenting, event management, and community management. Currently trying to learn some basics of coding to help out my colleagues in Daytona and to finally understand what the floof are they talking about on those tech meetings.🥲
